            <p>The following memo has been prepared to outline the Washington State Energy Code (WSEC) compliance results to evaluate code compliance of the current design for Microsoft Building K. A WSEC compliance model is only intended as 
                a tool to determine compliance with code and not as an indicator of as-built performance.</p>
            <h3>I. Model Inputs</h3>
                <p>The high-level modeling assumptions highlighting the major differences between the WSEC standard design and proposed designs are outlined below. 
                    The proposed system being evaluated is the dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) with radiant heating and cooling from the central utility plant (CUP). 
                    The WSEC standard design is built in accordance with Section C407 Total Energy Performance and the HVAC system is DOAS with four-pipe fan coils. Note, the standard HVAC is assuming a purchased energy fuel source from the central plant where the standard and proposed will have the same efficiencies in accordance to Table C4075.1(4).</p>
            <h3>II. Model Results</h3>
                <p> A SD-level energy model representing the WSEC standard design and proposed design building was created to check the current design for WSEC energy compliance. The following table shows the results of the compliance run:
